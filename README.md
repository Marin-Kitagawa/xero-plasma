With the help of this script you will be able to install **Plasma** in one of 4 methods as you can see in the image below. Not only that, it will also install the nVidia-dkms drivers and do necessary steps to get things working without you having to lift a finger... Oh yeah it will also fix **PipeWire** and bluetooth..

Work is still in progress. Once done I will provide a **Curl** command you will able to use.. As well as a video explaining everything. Until then, feel free to inspect the code and make sure you understand everything. ;)
